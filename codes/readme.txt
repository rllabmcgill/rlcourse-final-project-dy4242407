To test our algorithms in a relatively fast way:

To run the TD(lambda) control (ASRL) on the protytype summry, please run sarsa.py.
To run the actor critic with eligibility trace on the protytype summry, please run summarization_efficient.py

To produce the full results on DUC2004:
To run the TD(lambda) on DUC2004 task2, please run summary_sarsa.py.
To run the actor critic with eligibility trace on DUC2004 task2, please summary_ac.py.

document process is for pre process the DUC2004 task2 dataset and we also uploaded the codes throught the experiments.
